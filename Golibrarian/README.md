# GoLibrarian

GoLibraryAPI is a simple RESTful API for managing a library system, implemented in Go.

## Setting Up PostgreSQL for Library System

## Installation

To install PostgreSQL and its contrib package, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

## Starting PostgreSQL Service

Start the PostgreSQL service using the following command:

```bash
sudo service postgresql start
```

## Checking PostgreSQL Service Status

Check the status of the PostgreSQL service with:

```bash
sudo service postgresql status
```

## Enabling PostgreSQL Service

Enable the PostgreSQL service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

## Creating Database User and Database

Create a new PostgreSQL user and database for the library system:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive --pwprompt createdb library_system
```

## Accessing PostgreSQL Database

Access the PostgreSQL database using the created user and database:

```bash
psql -U your_username -d library_system -h localhost
```

Replace `your_username` with the username you created.

## Creating Books Table

Create a table named `books` to store book information:

```bash
psql -U your_username -d library_system -h localhost -c 
```

## Create Book table
```
CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER
);
```

Replace `your_username` with the username you created.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd GoLibrarian
2. Initialize Go module:
   ```bash
   go mod init deepak.gupta/GoLibraryAPI
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
   ```
   ```bash
   go get github.com/lib/pq
   ````

4. Run the Server:
   To run the GoLibraryAPI server, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
## Test the API

Use Postman to test the API endpoints. Here are the available endpoints:

    "author": "string",
    "year": "integer"
  }
## Update Book

### Request Format

- **Method:** PUT
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8080/books/{id}`
  - Replace `{id}` with the ID of the book to update.
- **Request Body Format:** JSON object representing the updated book. The object should have the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "string",
    "author": "string",
    "year": "integer"
  }
### Response Format

- **Description:** Updates details of a specific book by its ID.
- **Response Body Format:** JSON object representing the updated book. The object has the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "integer",
    "title": "string",
    "author": "string",

  - Replace `{id}` with the ID of the book to delete.

### Response Format

- **Description:** Deletes a specific book from the library by its ID.
- **Response Body Format:** This endpoint does not return a response body. The HTTP response status indicates the outcome of the deletion operation.


## Status Codes

### 200 OK
- **Description:** The request was successful.
- **Usage:** Returned for successful GET requests or successful updates (POST, PUT, DELETE) where a response body is not necessary.

### 201 Created
- **Description:** The resource was successfully created.
- **Usage:** Returned when a new resource is created, such as when adding a new book.

### 400 Bad Request
- **Description:** The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax or invalid data.
- **Usage:** Returned when the request body is invalid or missing required parameters.

### 404 Not Found
- **Description:** The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **Usage:** Returned when attempting to retrieve or manipulate a resource that does not exist, such as when fetching a book by ID that is not present in the library.

### 500 Internal Server Error
- **Description:** The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **Usage:** Returned for unexpected errors on the server side, such as database connection issues or internal logic errors.

These status codes help to communicate the outcome of the request to the client, indicating whether the operation was successful, encountered an error, or failed due to invalid input or missing resources.
